# Changelog

This log records tested changes and their acceptance status. Entries are grouped by date until a version is explicitly released.

## Unreleased

### 2026-11-05

#### Project setup

- Named the project ORPHEUS. Added architecture, local startup, and development instructions, plus persistent rules for Conventional Commits, review, and GitHub synchronization.
- Created `leafall903/ORPHEUS` with `main` as its default branch. The original local Git history retains the research material for development.

#### Baseline

- Integrated local login, lobby, match handoff, collision movement, statescript and encrypted UDP replication for build 104319.
- Added controlled input and packet replay, registered server state comparisons, and collision data readiness. Earlier offline real Practice Range evidence covers movement, bot damage, elimination, and respawn.
- Fixed bot creation ordering and latest health delivery after ACK, terminal script recovery on deliberate same-hero reselect, and the repeated self-reference of a Stack modifier.

#### Verification and acceptance

- The baseline at `5ce3414` passed 1086 Python tests. Ruff and Git diff checks passed.
- The manual test of the earlier `aeb2d57` copy still had gaps in animation and HUD, target feedback, names, kill feed, audio, void death, and hero skills. Complete Soldier: 76 and Practice Range client acceptance remains pending.

#### Fixed

- Retired a player's old health, hit history and respawn timer when the body is replaced or the player leaves. A second body now waits for its own death timer, even if an earlier body was replaced before its timer expired.
- Passed 55 targeted Python tests covering the two-death regression, body recovery, repeated switches and reentry, encrypted server replay, and bot notices. Ruff and Git diff checks passed. Client acceptance for the change is pending.

#### Repository checks

- Kept the CI relay compilation check and removed its artifact upload. Verified the workflow diff and checked that the build and regression steps remain in the workflow.

#### Combat fixes

- Swept the final fraction of projectile flight before expiry. Soldier: 76's Helix Rockets now detect impacts in the final part of their configured range and report the time they actually flew.
- Used the volley timestamp for hitscan notice attribution. Shots caught up after missing input report their own frames. Their aim, position, and target rewind still use the available command sample.
- Passed 36 targeted projectile, combat, command epoch, and timing tests. Client acceptance for the changes is pending.

#### Standalone server

- Added an external runtime directory for protocol tables, graph and map data, the lobby signing input, Battle.net descriptors, and prepared collision. The preparation tool copies the required files from a local research checkout and writes a SHA-256 manifest.
- Made server-only modes load collision caches without searching for a client installation. Startup reports missing runtime files before binding, and the map loader reports missing collision.
- Kept upstream notices and references, added the project contributor list, and documented the separate publication history and GitHub synchronization workflow.
- Passed 69 targeted Python tests, including lobby wire vectors and collision readiness, plus Ruff and Git diff checks. An isolated Windows deployment completed a signed lobby handshake and served the Battle.net WebSocket, dashboard, and UDP match. The Practice Range loaded its prepared collision and spawned 15 bots. Manual client acceptance is pending.
- Passed all 1091 Python tests for the standalone server change in the prepared development checkout.

#### GitHub synchronization

- Published the audited standalone server source on GitHub `main`. Verified the public branch head, the complete reachable object audit, and the clean checkout startup with external runtime data.
- Rehearsed the local synchronization command through history export, strict audit, fast-forward verification, and isolated startup. Documented the command for future tested commits.
- Configured the repository to credit new commits to `leafall903` using the GitHub noreply identity. Codex assistance is recorded in the `Assisted-by` trailer.

#### Biotic Field

- Replicated Soldier: 76's field skin theme to the caster and observers, including the Grillmaster theme. Shared the normal entity creation and movement encoder for the parented and world-space field records. The default field records retain their original wire bytes.
- Passed 72 targeted tests covering the theme, the caster's canister binding, observer placement, healing, expiry, and server replay. Ruff and Git diff checks passed. Client rendering and target-build canister placement are pending acceptance.

#### Statescript vectors

- Preserved the XYZ coordinates of vector constants in the build 104319 graph export. Biotic Field's launch and target-centre offsets now evaluate to their configured values in the shared interpreter. Lowercase coordinates remain supported.
- Passed 83 tests for expressions, abilities, body replication and graph extraction. Live behavior and the Biotic Field launch and collision path remain pending.

#### Match handoff

- Rejected UDP handshakes for expired or cancelled match seats immediately, even when the scheduler receives a packet before the tick that releases the seat. A valid handshake can still claim its seat until the deadline.
- Passed 93 tests covering the production scheduling loop, encrypted handoff, cancellation replay, matchmaking, and leaving. Broader scheduler replay and manual client acceptance remain pending.

#### Target list replication

- Encoded ordered entity and age entries supplied to the shared TrackTargets owner payload. Empty lists keep their existing wire representation.
- Passed 66 tests covering the client-derived codec, a Tactical Visor owner delta, body replication and server replay. Target selection, age calculation, authoritative aim and client acceptance remain pending.

#### Scheduler replay

- Ran finite UDP datagrams, timeouts and receive errors through the production game scheduler in memory. Replay checks clock reads, skipped ticks, socket calls, encrypted sends and ordered join and leave callbacks.
- Exercised controlled callback reentry using the existing seat cancellation and player removal methods. Invalid scripts and scheduler or callback failures reject the journal. Stored-state mode compares stopped boundaries around the loop.
- Passed 53 primary tests and the isolated snapshot regressions. A real 0688 Practice Range replay matched 74 receives and 26 encrypted sends, including Soldier: 76 spawn and a callback-driven seat cancellation. Live thread interleavings and manual client acceptance remain pending.

#### Collision fingerprint validation

- Compared derived collision cache entries directly before encoding the geometry fingerprint. The comparison retains exact types, finite numbers and signed zero checks.
- Passed 29 final collision fingerprint and tape tests. Ten A/B samples on a warmed 0688 world produced identical descriptors, with approximately 21% less median CPU time for the diagnostic fingerprint. Client acceptance remains pending.

#### Practice Range HUD initialization

- Enabled the initialized shared-variable state in the Practice Range HUD graph `20E4`, matching its entry in the 104319 graph. The owner frame size and PvP reference packet are unchanged.
- Passed 91 tests covering owner-frame decoding, selection, body replication, abilities and notices. Client HUD color, sprint animation and the full sprint presentation remain pending.

#### Predicted projectile timing

- Assigned predicted projectile leases and shot records to the statescript volley frame. A Biotic Field cast that finishes during a missed command window now confirms the scheduled canister ID when input resumes.
- Passed 38 projectile, combat, hitscan and ability regressions. The catch-up path still uses the available aiming and position sample. Canister placement and client prediction remain pending acceptance.

#### Match mode HUD initialization

- Started `0CB6 st21` in the match mode's initial and countdown frames, matching the shared-variable entry in the 104319 graph. Existing countdown values still decode from those frames.
- Passed 90 primary regressions and decoded the active mode HUD state from an encrypted 0688 Practice Range frame. A separate real-cache test decoded 47 controller full frames across 23 Soldier: 76 body lifecycles, including ten hero round trips and ten rejoins. HUD rendering and notices remain pending client acceptance.
