# Changelog

This log records tested changes and their acceptance status. Entries are grouped by date until a version is explicitly released.

## Unreleased

### 2026-11-05

#### Project setup

- Named the project ORPHEUS. Added architecture, local startup, and development instructions, plus persistent rules for Conventional Commits, review, and GitHub synchronization.
- Created `leafall903/ORPHEUS` with `main` as its default branch. The original local Git history retains the research material for development.

#### Baseline

- Integrated local login, lobby, match handoff, collision movement, statescript and encrypted UDP replication for build 104319.
- Added controlled input and packet replay, registered server state comparisons, and collision data readiness. Earlier offline real Practice Range evidence covers movement, bot damage, elimination, and respawn.
- Fixed bot creation ordering and latest health delivery after ACK, terminal script recovery on deliberate same-hero reselect, and the repeated self-reference of a Stack modifier.

#### Verification and acceptance

- The baseline at `5ce3414` passed 1086 Python tests. Ruff and Git diff checks passed.
- The manual test of the earlier `aeb2d57` copy still had gaps in animation and HUD, target feedback, names, kill feed, audio, void death, and hero skills. Complete Soldier: 76 and Practice Range client acceptance remains pending.

#### Fixed

- Retired a player's old health, hit history and respawn timer when the body is replaced or the player leaves. A second body now waits for its own death timer, even if an earlier body was replaced before its timer expired.
- Passed 55 targeted Python tests covering the two-death regression, body recovery, repeated switches and reentry, encrypted server replay, and bot notices. Ruff and Git diff checks passed. Client acceptance for the change is pending.

#### Repository checks

- Kept the CI relay compilation check and removed its artifact upload. Verified the workflow diff and checked that the build and regression steps remain in the workflow.

#### Combat fixes

- Swept the final fraction of projectile flight before expiry. Soldier: 76's Helix Rockets now detect impacts in the final part of their configured range and report the time they actually flew.
- Used the volley timestamp for hitscan notice attribution. Shots caught up after missing input report their own frames. Their aim, position, and target rewind still use the available command sample.
- Passed 36 targeted projectile, combat, command epoch, and timing tests. Client acceptance for the changes is pending.

#### Standalone server

- Added an external runtime directory for protocol tables, graph and map data, the lobby signing input, Battle.net descriptors, and prepared collision. The preparation tool copies the required files from a local research checkout and writes a SHA-256 manifest.
- Made server-only modes load collision caches without searching for a client installation. Startup reports missing runtime files before binding, and the map loader reports missing collision.
- Kept upstream notices and references, added the project contributor list, and documented the separate publication history and GitHub synchronization workflow.
- Passed 69 targeted Python tests, including lobby wire vectors and collision readiness, plus Ruff and Git diff checks. An isolated Windows deployment completed a signed lobby handshake and served the Battle.net WebSocket, dashboard, and UDP match. The Practice Range loaded its prepared collision and spawned 15 bots. Manual client acceptance is pending.
- Passed all 1091 Python tests for the standalone server change in the prepared development checkout.

#### GitHub synchronization

- Published the audited standalone server source on GitHub `main`. Verified the public branch head, the complete reachable object audit, and the clean checkout startup with external runtime data.
- Rehearsed the local synchronization command through history export, strict audit, fast-forward verification, and isolated startup. Documented the command for future tested commits.

#### Biotic Field

- Replicated Soldier: 76's field skin theme to the caster and observers, including the Grillmaster theme. Shared the normal entity creation and movement encoder for the parented and world-space field records. The default field records retain their original wire bytes.
- Passed 72 targeted tests covering the theme, the caster's canister binding, observer placement, healing, expiry, and server replay. Ruff and Git diff checks passed. Client rendering and target-build canister placement are pending acceptance.
